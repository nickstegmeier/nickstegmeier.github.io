### What this blog about?

*Now With Simplicity* is a blog devoted to explaining complex ideas simply - but not necessarily succinctly. Most would agree that to convey a complex idea, you must be able to describe it in simple terms. But that's not the end of the story. Newtonian physics is famously described in three simple, succinct laws. That doesn't make understanding the diverse implications any easier! Hidden beneath the succintness is a world of complexity. When I'm lost in the complexity of my own small problems in mathematics and computing, I often try to navigate towards understanding with totally concrete, utterly legible steps. It seems to help. In this blog, I reproduce those steps for anyone that's interested.


### Who's writing it?

I'm Nick Stegmeier, a graduate student at South Dakota State University. I like mathematics, computing, and science. I came up with the name *Now With Simplicity* partly because many complex ideas *can* be simplified nicely, but I mostly tried matching it to  my initials (NWS) and made up the reason afterwards. And now I'd like to discuss how post-hoc reasoning is an unforgivable sin...
